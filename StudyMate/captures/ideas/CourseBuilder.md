Designing a versatile and user-friendly course builder screen that caters to various types of courses, from university lectures to general learning modules, requires thoughtful consideration of flexibility, ease of use, and the ability to customize. Here's a brainstorm to guide the design of a more generalized and potentially customizable course builder:

### Core Components of the Course Builder Screen:

1. **Course Information**:
   - **Course Title**: Allow users to input a clear and descriptive title.
   - **Course Description**: A text field for a brief overview of the course objectives and content.
   - **Course Category/Tags**: Facilitate categorization and searchability through predefined tags or user-defined categories.

2. **Course Content Structure**:
   - **Dynamic Folder/Module Creation**: Instead of fixed "Lectures" and "Assignments" folders, enable users to create custom modules or folders (e.g., "Week 1", "Module A", "Supplementary Materials").
   - **Document Uploads**: Within each module or folder, allow the upload of various document types, including PDFs, text files, presentations, and possibly video links.
   - **Course Outline**: A dedicated section for uploading a course outline, with support for PDF and text documents. This could also be a "Course Introduction" module that automatically appears at the beginning.

3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Quizzes/Assessments**: Provide tools for creating quizzes or assessments to test knowledge retention.
   - **Discussion Boards**: A feature to enable course-related discussions among creators and learners.

4. **Course Settings**:
   - **Visibility Settings**: Options for making the course public, private, or accessible via invitation/link.
   - **Collaboration Settings**: Allow multiple users to contribute or edit course content, useful for team-taught courses or collaborative learning projects.

5. **Course Preview and Publishing**:
   - **Preview Mode**: Before publishing, creators can preview the course as it would appear to learners.
   - **Publish/Save Draft**: Options to publish the course immediately or save it as a draft for further editing.

### Additional Features for Consideration:

- **Template Library**: Offer templates for different course types to simplify the creation process (e.g., Academic Course, Workshop, Training Module).
  
- **Resource Bank**: A repository where creators can store and pull from commonly used resources or shared content.

- **Accessibility Features**: Tools to ensure course content is accessible, such as alternative text for images or captioning for videos.

- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Incorporate ways to gather feedback on individual modules or the course overall, facilitating iterative improvement.

- **Certification/Completion Tracking**: If applicable, provide certificates or badges upon course completion, or track progress through the course.

By allowing for customizable content structures while providing robust support for course creation, your app can cater to a wide range of educational needs. Keeping the interface intuitive and guiding users through the creation process with tips or a step-by-step wizard could enhance user experience, making course creation an accessible and fulfilling activity for all users, regardless of their technical proficiency or educational background.
