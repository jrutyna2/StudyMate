Yes, there are several apps that blend learning with interactive features, course creation, and community engagement. While each has its unique focus, they share the core idea of making education more accessible and interactive. Here are a few examples:

1. **Coursera** and **Udemy**: Both platforms allow educators to create and publish courses on a wide range of subjects. While primarily focused on adult education, they offer interactive features like quizzes, assignments, and community forums. These platforms are more focused on formal education with a wide range of topics.

2. **Khan Academy**: Known for its personalized learning dashboard, practice exercises, and instructional videos, Khan Academy supports learners in a wide range of subjects. While it doesn't allow users to create their own courses, its interactive and tailored approach to education is noteworthy.

3. **Duolingo**: Specializes in language learning through gamification and bite-sized lessons. It doesn't support user-generated courses, but its interactive approach and emphasis on making learning fun have parallels to what you're envisioning.

4. **Quizlet**: Allows users to create study sets for various subjects, which can be shared with others. It includes features like flashcards, quizzes, and games, making it a tool for both learning and teaching.

5. **Edmodo**: Functions as a learning management system that bridges the gap between educators and students. Teachers can create classes, distribute assignments, and communicate with students, fostering a community around education.

6. **Skillshare**: Focuses on creative education, offering courses on topics like design, photography, and more. Educators can create and share their courses, providing an interactive learning experience through projects and community feedback.

While these apps offer various interactive features, community engagement, and course creation tools, your idea of integrating personal AI study assistance, schedule management, and customizable course creation presents a unique combination that could cater to specific needs within the e-learning space.

To differentiate your app, consider focusing on features that are less commonly found together in existing apps, such as combining AI-driven study assistance with the ability for users to create and share their own educational content. This unique blend could cater to learners who seek a more personalized and interactive educational experience.
